This is the student modeling. 

We are building some trajectory model:

- Markov model
- VAE-RNN model

Steps:
- Pakcage the data, write loading script
- Make sure the data loading is fine 
- Write the model (let's just stick with RNN-VAE for now)
- Train the model, measure the success (MSE)?
(Or just try an esemble of models and see how Offline RL algorithms react?)
